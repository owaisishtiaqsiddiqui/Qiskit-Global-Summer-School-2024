# Qiskit-Global-Summer-School-2024
Qiskit Global Summer School 2024 is a two-week intensive program, and it is held each year. This program is designed so researchers will know how to explore the world of quantum computing. 

In case you want to start this lab by yourself, then this [link](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qgss-2024/tree/main) is for you.

In this repository we will go through how to tackle problems analytically and then we will slowly learn to program accordingly. There are four labs in total and each lab has several questions, so it is a pretty good way of testing and building your skills. Let's go!!
